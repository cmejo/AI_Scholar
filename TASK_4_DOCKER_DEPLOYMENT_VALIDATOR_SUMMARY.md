- **Package Management**: Checks apt-get usage patterns and best practices
- **Security Analysis**: Identifies security issues like privileged users and permissions
- **Best Practices**: Detects deprecated commands and missing health checks
- **Ubuntu-Specific Checks**: Validates apt cache cleanup and Ubuntu-compatible commands

#### 2. Docker Compose Analyzer (`DockerComposeAnalyzer`)
- **YAML Validation**: Checks for valid YAML syntax and structure
- **Service Configuration**: Validates service definitions and required fields
- **Network Analysis**: Reviews network configurations and external networks
- **Volume Analysis**: Checks volume configurations and external volumes
- **Security Checks**: Identifies privileged mode and security issues
- **Environment Variables**: Validates environment variable configurations

#### 3. Deployment Script Analyzer (`DeploymentScriptAnalyzer`)
- **Ubuntu Compatibility**: Checks for Ubuntu-incompatible commands (yum, dnf, etc.)
- **Shell Compatibility**: Validates shell script syntax and best practices
- **Security Analysis**: Identifies dangerous commands and unsafe practices
- **Path Validation**: Checks for hardcoded paths that may not exist on Ubuntu
- **Shebang Validation**: Ensures proper script headers

#### 4. Environment Configuration Analyzer (`EnvironmentConfigAnalyzer`)
- **Format Validation**: Checks environment file syntax and format
- **Security Analysis**: Identifies sensitive data exposure in env files
- **Duplicate Detection**: Finds duplicate environment variable definitions
- **Value Validation**: Checks for empty or invalid values

### Key Features

#### Ubuntu Compatibility Focus
- **Base Image Validation**: Ensures Docker images are Ubuntu-compatible
- **Package Manager Checks**: Validates apt-get usage patterns
- **Path Compatibility**: Identifies hardcoded paths that may not work on Ubuntu
- **Command Compatibility**: Detects non-Ubuntu package managers and commands

#### Comprehensive Issue Classification
- **Issue Types**: Dockerfile, Docker Compose, Deployment Script, Environment Config, Security, Ubuntu Compatibility
- **Severity Levels**: Critical, High, Medium, Low, Info
- **Ubuntu-Specific Flagging**: Issues specifically related to Ubuntu compatibility
- **Auto-Fix Identification**: Issues that can be automatically resolved

#### Detailed Reporting
- **JSON Output**: Machine-readable results for integration
