## ü§î The Problem: Research in Crisis

Modern research faces unprecedented challenges:

- **Information Overload**: Over 3 million research papers published annually, making comprehensive literature reviews nearly impossible
- **Language Barriers**: 60% of cutting-edge research is published in non-English languages, creating knowledge silos
- **Reproducibility Crisis**: 70% of researchers can't reproduce others' experiments, undermining scientific progress
- **Collaboration Friction**: Cross-institutional and international collaboration remains complex and inefficient
- **Integrity Concerns**: Research fraud and questionable practices threaten the foundation of scientific trust

These aren't just academic problems ‚Äî they're barriers to solving humanity's greatest challenges, from climate change to disease to technological advancement.
