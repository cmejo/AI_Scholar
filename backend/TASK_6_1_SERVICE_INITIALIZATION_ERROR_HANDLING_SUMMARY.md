### 2. Enhanced Database Service Initialization

#### Comprehensive Error Handling Features
- **Import Error Handling**: Safe imports with detailed error logging for missing dependencies
- **Timeout Protection**: 60-second timeout for database initialization, 30-second timeout for service retrieval
- **Dependency Validation**: Detailed validation of database service availability and health
- **Step-by-Step Logging**: Detailed logging for each initialization step with timing information
- **Fallback Strategy**: Configurable recovery strategy (set to "fail" for database service)

#### Error Scenarios Covered
- Import failures for database service modules
- Database initialization function failures
- Database service getter failures
- Timeout scenarios during initialization
- Unexpected errors with full stack traces

### 3. Enhanced Semantic Search Service Initialization

#### Advanced Error Handling Features
- **Dependency Checking**: Comprehensive validation of required dependencies (numpy, sqlalchemy)
- **Service Class Import Validation**: Safe import of SemanticSearchV2Service with fallback
- **Database Service Dependency Validation**: Health check of database service dependency
- **Enhanced Factory Function**: Comprehensive error handling in service factory with fallback to mock service
- **Mock Service Fallback**: Enhanced mock service initialization with detailed logging

#### Mock Service Error Handling
- **Dedicated Mock Initialization Method**: `_initialize_mock_semantic_search_service_with_error_handling()`
- **Reason Tracking**: Tracks and logs the reason for falling back to mock service
- **Reduced Retry Logic**: Optimized retry strategy for mock services
- **Status Tracking**: Proper status tracking for mock services (marked as DEGRADED)

### 4. Error Logging Enhancements

#### Structured Logging Format
All error logs now include:
- **Event Type**: Categorized event types for easy filtering and monitoring
- **Service Name**: Clear identification of which service is being initialized
- **Timing Information**: Detailed timing for initialization steps and total duration
- **Error Context**: Comprehensive error context including error types, messages, and stack traces
- **Attempt Information**: Retry attempt numbers and strategies applied
- **Dependency Information**: Details about service dependencies and their status

#### Log Categories Implemented
- `service_initialization_start` - Service initialization begins
- `service_initialization_error` - Errors during initialization
- `service_initialization_success` - Successful initialization
- `service_initialization_complete_failure` - Complete initialization failure
- `service_status_change` - Service status changes
- `dependency_check_failed` - Dependency validation failures
- `fallback_initialization_success` - Successful fallback initialization
- `mock_service_initialization_start` - Mock service initialization begins

### 5. Recovery and Retry Mechanisms

#### Recovery Strategies
1. **Fallback Strategy**: Attempts to initialize with mock/fallback service
2. **Retry Strategy**: Retries with exponential backoff
3. **Fail-Fast Strategy**: Stops retries immediately on failure

#### Retry Logic Features
- **Configurable Retry Counts**: Default 3 retries, configurable per service
- **Exponential Backoff**: Retry delay increases by 1.5x each attempt
- **Timeout Protection**: 30-second timeout per initialization attempt
- **Attempt Tracking**: Detailed logging of each retry attempt with timing

#### Fallback Mechanisms
- **Mock Service Fallback**: Automatic fallback to mock services for core services
- **Final Fallback Attempt**: Last-resort fallback after all regular attempts fail
- **Status Degradation**: Services using fallback are marked as DEGRADED rather than FAILED

### 6. Service Health Monitoring Integration

#### Enhanced Health Status Tracking
- **Detailed Health Information**: Comprehensive health status with error messages and timing
- **Initialization Time Tracking**: Tracks how long each service took to initialize
- **Dependency Tracking**: Tracks service dependencies and their health status
- **Status Change Logging**: Logs all service status changes with reasons

#### Health Check Enhancements
- **Validation During Initialization**: Health checks performed during service validation
- **Timeout Protection**: 10-second timeout for health checks during initialization
- **Error Tolerance**: Health check failures don't prevent service initialization
- **Capability Logging**: Logs service capabilities if available

## Testing and Validation

### Comprehensive Test Suite
Created `test_service_initialization_error_handling.py` with the following test cases:

1. **Invalid Service Name Test**: Validates handling of empty/invalid service names
2. **Non-Callable Factory Test**: Validates handling of non-callable service factories
3. **Missing Dependencies Test**: Validates handling of missing service dependencies
4. **Successful Initialization Test**: Validates normal successful initialization flow
5. **Factory Returns None Test**: Validates handling of factories that return None
6. **Factory Exception Test**: Validates retry mechanism for failing factories
7. **Fallback Recovery Test**: Validates fallback recovery strategy
8. **Health Status Tracking Test**: Validates service health status tracking
9. **Initialization Summary Test**: Validates initialization summary reporting
