    async def process_thumbs_feedback(user_id, message_id, is_positive, context)
    async def process_detailed_rating(user_id, message_id, rating, aspects, comment, context)
```

**Features:**
- Handles 4 feedback types: RATING, CORRECTION, PREFERENCE, RELEVANCE
- Integrates with user profile service for personalization updates
- Processes thumbs up/down feedback with 1.0/0.0 rating conversion
- Detailed rating with aspect-specific scores (accuracy, relevance, completeness, clarity)
- Correction feedback for factual and formatting improvements
- Preference feedback for response style, domain focus, and citation format
- Relevance feedback with source-specific ratings

#### 2. FeedbackAnalyzer Class
```python
class FeedbackAnalyzer:
    async def analyze_feedback_trends(user_id, time_range, feedback_types)
    def _analyze_by_type(feedback_records)
    def _analyze_rating_trends(feedback_records)
```

**Features:**
- Comprehensive trend analysis across time periods
- Feedback distribution by type (rating, correction, preference, relevance)
- Rating trend analysis with average scores and distribution
- User-specific and system-wide analytics
- Performance metrics and improvement area identification

#### 3. FeedbackLoop Class
```python
class FeedbackLoop:
    async def run_improvement_cycle()
    async def _identify_improvements(analysis)
    async def _apply_improvements(improvements)
```

**Features:**
- Automated improvement cycles based on feedback analysis
- Identifies system performance issues from poor ratings
- Applies behavioral adjustments for better user experience
- Tracks improvement effectiveness over time
- Integration with analytics for continuous monitoring

### Database Integration

#### Enhanced UserFeedback Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_feedback (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    message_id UUID REFERENCES messages(id),
    feedback_type VARCHAR(50), -- 'rating', 'correction', 'preference', 'relevance'
    feedback_value JSONB,
    processed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### User Profile Updates
- Satisfaction history tracking with rolling averages
- Aspect-specific satisfaction scores (accuracy, relevance, completeness, clarity)
- Preference updates from feedback patterns
- Domain expertise inference from corrections

### Analytics Integration

#### Feedback Analytics Events
- `feedback_processed`: General feedback processing events
