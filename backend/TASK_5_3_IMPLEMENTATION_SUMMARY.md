- Key insights extraction
- Relevance assessment and confidence metrics

**Methods**:
- `reason()`: Main summarization logic

- Word count and processing time

### 3. ResearchAgent
**Purpose**: Performs deep topic analysis and comprehensive research

**Key Features**:
- Multiple research depths (comprehensive, focused, deep)
- Structured analysis across multiple dimensions
- Knowledge gap identification
- Research confidence assessment

**Methods**:
- `reason()`: Main research logic
- `_parse_research_response()`: Extracts structured research components

**Research Areas**:
- Background analysis
- Current state assessment
- Key relationships and connections
- Implications and significance
- Knowledge gaps and limitations

**Output Metadata**:
- Detailed analysis for each research area
- Research confidence metrics
- Processing time and depth indicators

### 4. AgentCoordinator
**Purpose**: Coordinates multiple agents and integrates their results

**Key Features**:
- Automatic agent selection based on query analysis
- Parallel agent execution
- Result integration and synthesis
- Performance metrics aggregation

**Methods**:
- `coordinate_agents()`: Orchestrates multiple agents

- `integrate_results()`: Combines and synthesizes agent outputs

**Integration Capabilities**:
- Evidence combination from multiple sources
- Key insights aggregation
- Confidence score calculation
- Performance metrics summary

### 5. ReasoningEngine Integration
**Purpose**: Seamless integration with existing reasoning infrastructure

**New Methods**:
- `apply_specialized_agents()`: Apply multiple agents to a query
- `fact_check()`: Direct fact-checking interface
- `summarize()`: Direct summarization interface
- `research()`: Direct research interface
- `integrate_agent_results()`: Result integration interface
