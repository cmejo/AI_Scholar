Task 4.2 Verification Test

This test specifically verifies that the implementation meets the requirements
for Task 4.2: Implement advanced search functionality

Requirements being tested:
- 3.2: WHEN searching THEN the system SHALL support faceted search by author, year, publication, and tags
- 3.3: WHEN displaying search results THEN the system SHALL rank results by relevance
- 3.7: WHEN no results are found THEN the system SHALL provide helpful suggestions

This test validates the actual service implementation.
