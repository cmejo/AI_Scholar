- **Law**: Configured for legal documents, regulations, and compliance content

**Key Methods:**
- `detect_user_domains()`: Detects user domain preferences from interaction patterns
- `get_domain_specific_strategy()`: Returns domain-specific configuration for retrieval and response
- `adapt_retrieval_results()`: Applies domain-specific scoring to search results
- `update_domain_adaptation()`: Updates domain learning based on user feedback

### 2. DomainDetector Service (`services/domain_adapter.py`)

**Features:**
- **Document Domain Detection**: Automatically detects domains from document content
- **Auto-Tagging**: Creates domain tags for documents based on content analysis
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides confidence scores for detected domains

**Key Methods:**
- `detect_document_domain()`: Detects domains in document content
- `auto_tag_document_domains()`: Automatically tags documents with detected domains

### 3. Domain-Specific Configurations

Each domain has specialized settings for:
- **Chunk Size**: Optimized chunk sizes (600-1200 tokens)
- **Overlap Ratio**: Domain-appropriate overlap percentages (0.1-0.3)
- **Complexity Weight**: Preference for content complexity (0.5-0.9)
- **Recency Weight**: Importance of content freshness (0.5-0.9)
- **Citation Style**: Domain-appropriate citation formats
- **Reasoning Emphasis**: Preferred reasoning types (causal, analytical, etc.)
- **Content Types**: Preferred content formats (documentation, research, etc.)

### 4. Integration Points

**Database Integration:**
- Enhanced user profiles with domain expertise tracking
- Document tags for domain classification

    "reasoning_emphasis": ["causal", "evidence-based", "diagnostic"]
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Domain Detection
```python
domain_adapter = DomainAdapter(db)
domains = await domain_adapter.detect_user_domains("user-123")
# Returns: {"technology": 0.8, "science": 0.6, "business": 0.3}
```

### Strategy Generation
```python
strategy = await domain_adapter.get_domain_specific_strategy(
    "user-123", 
    "How to implement machine learning algorithms?"
)
# Returns domain-specific configuration for technology domain
```

### Document Classification
```python
domain_detector = DomainDetector(db)
domains = await domain_detector.detect_document_domain(
    "doc-123", 
    "Software development best practices..."
)
# Returns: [("technology", 0.9), ("programming", 0.7)]
```
