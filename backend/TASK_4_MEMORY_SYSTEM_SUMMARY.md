### Memory Integration Flow
```
User Query → Store in Memory → Retrieve Context → Enhanced Search → 
Generate Response → Store Response → Learn Preferences → Update Memory
```

## Key Components

### 1. ConversationMemoryManager
- **Purpose**: Manages short-term conversation memory with Redis backend
- **Features**: Importance scoring, automatic pruning, expiration handling
- **Storage**: Redis (fast access) + SQLite (persistence)

### 2. ContextCompressor
- **Purpose**: Compresses long conversations for efficient processing
- **Features**: Intelligent summarization, relevance pruning, token management
- **Algorithms**: Content similarity, time proximity, importance weighting

### 3. UserMemoryStore
- **Purpose**: Manages long-term user preferences and learning
- **Features**: Preference learning, domain expertise, personalized context
- **Storage**: Redis (cache) + SQLite (persistence)

### 4. RAG Service Integration
- **Purpose**: Memory-aware query processing and response generation
- **Features**: Context continuity, personalization, multi-turn support
- **Integration**: Seamless memory operations in query/response cycle

## Database Schema

### Enhanced Tables
- `conversation_memory`: Stores conversation memory items
- `user_profiles`: User preferences and learning data
- `user_feedback`: User feedback for system improvement
- `analytics_events`: Usage analytics and patterns

### Redis Data Structures
- `conversation_memory:{id}`: Conversation context cache
- `user_preferences:{id}`: User preference cache
- `user_session:{id}`: Active session data
- `interaction_signals:{id}`: Learning signals cache

## Configuration Options

### Memory Settings
```python
max_short_term_items = 50          # Maximum memories per conversation
max_context_tokens = 4000          # Token limit before compression
memory_retention_hours = 24        # Memory expiration time
compression_ratio = 0.3            # Target compression ratio
min_importance_threshold = 0.4     # Minimum importance for retention
```

### User Preference Settings
```python
preference_learning_threshold = 3   # Interactions needed to learn preference
memory_retention_days = 30         # User context retention period
personalization_level = 1.0        # Default personalization strength
```
