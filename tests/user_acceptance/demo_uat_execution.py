📊 OVERALL METRICS:
   • Test Duration: 14 days
   • Beta Participants: 25 users
   • Test Scenarios: 10 completed
   • Issues Found: 23 total
   • Quality Gates: {passed_gates}/{total_gates} passed

🎯 KEY FINDINGS:
   • Strong user satisfaction (4.2/5) with core features
   • Citation generation and library import highly valued
   • Performance issues with large libraries need attention
   • Accessibility compliance requires improvement
   • 4 critical bugs must be fixed before release

⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUES REQUIRING IMMEDIATE ATTENTION:
   1. Large library import timeout (affects 15% of users)
   2. Focus management in modal dialogs
   3. Missing form labels for screen readers
   4. Search performance degradation with 5000+ items

✅ STRENGTHS:
   • Intuitive user interface
   • Reliable citation generation
   • Good integration with existing AI Scholar features
   • Strong security implementation

📋 RECOMMENDATIONS:
   1. Fix critical bugs before production release
   2. Implement accessibility improvements for WCAG compliance
   3. Optimize performance for large libraries
   4. Add mobile support (top user request)
   5. Expand citation style support

🚦 RELEASE RECOMMENDATION:
   Status: CONDITIONAL APPROVAL
   
   The Zotero integration feature shows strong potential with high user
   satisfaction, but requires addressing critical issues before production
   release. Recommend fixing accessibility and performance issues, then
   conducting focused re-testing of problem areas.
