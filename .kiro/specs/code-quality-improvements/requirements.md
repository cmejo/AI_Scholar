# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on implementing comprehensive code quality improvements across the AI Scholar RAG chatbot project. The analysis reveals significant code quality issues including extensive use of `any` types, unused variables, missing dependencies in React hooks, inconsistent error handling, and lack of proper type safety. This feature will establish robust code quality standards, implement automated quality checks, and systematically address existing technical debt to improve maintainability, reliability, and developer experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive TypeScript type safety throughout the codebase, so that I can catch type-related errors at compile time and improve code reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the codebase is analyzed THEN the system SHALL eliminate all instances of `any` types and replace them with proper TypeScript interfaces and types
2. WHEN TypeScript compilation occurs THEN the system SHALL enforce strict type checking with no type errors
3. WHEN new code is written THEN the system SHALL prevent the use of `any` types through ESLint rules
4. WHEN interfaces are defined THEN the system SHALL ensure they are properly exported and reused across components

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated code quality enforcement, so that code quality standards are consistently maintained across the project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed THEN the system SHALL run automated linting and type checking
2. WHEN ESLint rules are violated THEN the system SHALL prevent code from being merged
3. WHEN Python code is written THEN the system SHALL enforce PEP 8 standards and type hints
4. WHEN code quality metrics fall below thresholds THEN the system SHALL generate alerts and reports

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging throughout the application, so that issues can be quickly identified and resolved in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur in React components THEN the system SHALL implement proper error boundaries and user-friendly error messages
2. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL provide consistent error handling with appropriate user feedback
3. WHEN backend services encounter errors THEN the system SHALL log errors with proper context and stack traces
4. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive logging without exposing sensitive information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean and maintainable code structure, so that the codebase is easy to understand, modify, and extend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unused variables and imports are present THEN the system SHALL automatically remove them
2. WHEN React hooks are used THEN the system SHALL ensure all dependencies are properly declared
3. WHEN functions become too complex THEN the system SHALL enforce complexity limits and suggest refactoring
4. WHEN code is duplicated THEN the system SHALL identify and eliminate duplication through shared utilities

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing coverage and quality, so that code changes can be made confidently without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new code is written THEN the system SHALL require corresponding unit tests with minimum coverage thresholds
2. WHEN integration tests are needed THEN the system SHALL provide proper test utilities and mocking capabilities
3. WHEN tests are run THEN the system SHALL generate coverage reports and identify untested code paths
4. WHEN test quality is assessed THEN the system SHALL ensure tests are meaningful and not just coverage-driven

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent code formatting and style, so that the codebase maintains a professional appearance and reduces cognitive load during code reviews.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is written THEN the system SHALL automatically format it according to established style guidelines
2. WHEN pull requests are created THEN the system SHALL ensure consistent formatting across all files
3. WHEN different developers contribute THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent naming conventions and code organization
4. WHEN configuration files are present THEN the system SHALL ensure they follow consistent patterns and are properly documented

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance optimization and monitoring, so that the application runs efficiently and performance regressions are quickly identified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN React components render THEN the system SHALL optimize re-renders and prevent unnecessary updates
2. WHEN large datasets are processed THEN the system SHALL implement efficient algorithms and data structures
3. WHEN performance bottlenecks exist THEN the system SHALL provide profiling tools and optimization recommendations
4. WHEN bundle size increases THEN the system SHALL analyze and optimize import statements and dependencies

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper documentation and code comments, so that the codebase is self-documenting and easy for new team members to understand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN complex functions are written THEN the system SHALL require JSDoc/docstring documentation
2. WHEN APIs are defined THEN the system SHALL generate and maintain up-to-date API documentation
3. WHEN architectural decisions are made THEN the system SHALL document them in appropriate README files
4. WHEN code comments are needed THEN the system SHALL ensure they explain the "why" rather than the "what"
