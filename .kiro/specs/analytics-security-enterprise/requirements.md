# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing Phases 4 and 5 of the AI Scholar frontend restoration project. Phase 4 focuses on Analytics & Security Dashboard features, while Phase 5 covers Enterprise Features & Integrations. These phases will restore the enterprise-level capabilities that were temporarily removed to establish the basic chatbot functionality.

The implementation will leverage existing backend services including advanced analytics, security monitoring, workflow automation, and integration capabilities that are already available through the backend API endpoints.

2. WHEN the user configures an integration THEN the system SHALL provide secure credential management and connection testing
3. WHEN integrations are active THEN the system SHALL monitor connection health and data synchronization status
4. WHEN integration services fail THEN the system SHALL provide error diagnostics and recovery options
5. IF integration data is synchronized THEN the system SHALL log sync status and handle conflicts appropriately
6. WHEN the user manages API keys THEN the system SHALL provide secure storage and rotation capabilities

### Requirement 6: Performance Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor application performance, resource usage, and system health in real-time, so that I can proactively address performance issues and optimize system resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user views performance metrics THEN the system SHALL display real-time performance data including response times, resource usage, and error rates
2. WHEN performance thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL generate alerts and provide diagnostic information
3. WHEN the user analyzes performance trends THEN the system SHALL provide historical data visualization and trend analysis
4. WHEN performance monitoring services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL display cached data and service status information
5. IF performance issues are detected THEN the system SHALL provide actionable recommendations and troubleshooting guidance
6. WHEN the user configures monitoring THEN the system SHALL allow customization of metrics, thresholds, and alert preferences

### Requirement 7: Enterprise Services

**User Story:** As an enterprise user, I want access to comprehensive enterprise services including authentication, analytics, memory management, security monitoring, and accessibility features, so that I can use the system in a secure, monitored, and accessible manner.
