# Backend Service Restoration Requirements

## Introduction

This feature focuses on gradually restoring the full backend functionality after successfully fixing the container startup issues. The backend container is now running with minimal endpoints, and we need to systematically add back the complex services and endpoints without breaking the container stability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Service Import Restoration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to restore the service imports in the advanced endpoints, so that the full API functionality is available to the frontend application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a service import is added to advanced_endpoints.py THEN the container SHALL continue to start successfully
2. WHEN a service import fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages in the container logs
3. WHEN all service imports are restored THEN the container SHALL maintain the same startup time as the minimal version
4. IF a service import causes startup failure THEN the system SHALL allow rollback to the previous working state

### Requirement 2: Endpoint Functionality Restoration

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want all the original API endpoints to be functional, so that I can integrate the full feature set into the user interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an endpoint is restored THEN it SHALL respond with the expected data structure
2. WHEN an endpoint encounters an error THEN it SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages
3. WHEN all endpoints are restored THEN they SHALL be accessible through the FastAPI documentation at /docs
4. IF an endpoint depends on external services THEN it SHALL handle service unavailability gracefully

### Requirement 3: Database Integration Restoration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the database connections to be restored, so that the application can persist and retrieve data as designed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database models are imported THEN the container SHALL start without connection errors
2. WHEN database operations are performed THEN they SHALL complete successfully or return meaningful error messages
3. WHEN the database is unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue to function for non-database dependent endpoints
4. IF database migrations are needed THEN they SHALL be applied automatically during container startup

### Requirement 4: Error Handling and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and monitoring, so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues during the restoration process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs during service initialization THEN it SHALL be logged with sufficient detail for debugging
2. WHEN a service fails to start THEN the system SHALL continue with available services and log the failure
3. WHEN monitoring endpoints are called THEN they SHALL return the current status of all services
4. IF critical services fail THEN the system SHALL return appropriate health check status

### Requirement 5: Incremental Testing and Validation

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want each restoration step to be thoroughly tested, so that we can ensure system stability throughout the process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a service is restored THEN automated tests SHALL verify its functionality
2. WHEN endpoints are added back THEN they SHALL be tested with sample requests
3. WHEN the restoration is complete THEN all original functionality SHALL be verified through integration tests
4. IF any test fails THEN the restoration process SHALL pause for investigation and resolution
