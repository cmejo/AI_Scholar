# Backend Service Restoration Design

## Overview

This design outlines a systematic approach to restore the full backend functionality by gradually adding back services, endpoints, and database integrations while maintaining container stability. The approach prioritizes incremental changes with validation at each step to prevent regression to the previous startup failures.

## Architecture

### Current State
- Minimal FastAPI application with basic health endpoints
- Container starts successfully with gunicorn
- Basic CORS middleware configured
- No complex service dependencies

### Target State
- Full service ecosystem restored
- All original API endpoints functional
- Database connections and models working
- Comprehensive error handling and monitoring
- Maintained container stability

### Restoration Strategy
The restoration follows a dependency-first approach:
1. **Foundation Services** - Core utilities and configurations
2. **Data Layer** - Database models and connections
3. **Business Logic Services** - Research, analytics, and AI services
4. **API Endpoints** - Complex endpoints that depend on services
5. **Integration Testing** - End-to-end validation

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. Service Manager
A centralized service manager to handle service initialization and health monitoring.

```python
class ServiceManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.services = {}
        self.health_status = {}
    
    async def initialize_service(self, service_name: str, service_class):
        # Initialize service with error handling
        # Update health status
        pass
    
    def get_service_health(self) -> dict:
        # Return current health status of all services
        pass
```

### 2. Gradual Import System
A system to conditionally import services based on availability and configuration.

```python
class ConditionalImporter:
    @staticmethod
    def safe_import(module_name: str, fallback=None):
        # Attempt import with graceful fallback
        pass
    
    @staticmethod
    def import_with_retry(module_name: str, max_retries: int = 3):
        # Import with retry logic for transient failures
        pass
```

### 3. Health Check Enhancement
Enhanced health check system that reports on individual service status.

```python
@router.get("/health/detailed")
async def detailed_health_check():
    return {
        "status": "ok",
        "services": service_manager.get_service_health(),
        "timestamp": datetime.utcnow()
    }
```

## Data Models

### Service Health Model
```python
class ServiceHealth(BaseModel):
    name: str
    status: Literal["healthy", "degraded", "unhealthy"]
    last_check: datetime
    error_message: Optional[str] = None
    dependencies: List[str] = []
```

### Restoration Progress Model
```python
class RestorationProgress(BaseModel):
    phase: str
    completed_services: List[str]
    failed_services: List[str]
    next_service: Optional[str]
    overall_progress: float
```

## Error Handling

### Service Initialization Errors
- **Strategy**: Graceful degradation with detailed logging
- **Implementation**: Try-catch blocks around service initialization
- **Fallback**: Continue with available services, mark failed services as unavailable

### Runtime Errors
- **Strategy**: Circuit breaker pattern for external dependencies
- **Implementation**: Retry logic with exponential backoff
- **Monitoring**: Health check endpoints report service status

### Database Connection Errors
- **Strategy**: Connection pooling with health checks
- **Implementation**: Async database connections with timeout handling
- **Fallback**: In-memory caching for read operations when database is unavailable

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Test each service initialization independently
- Mock external dependencies for isolated testing
- Validate error handling paths

### Integration Testing
- Test service interactions and dependencies
- Validate endpoint functionality with real services
- Test database operations and migrations

### Container Testing
- Validate container startup with each service addition
- Test container health checks and monitoring
- Verify resource usage and performance

### Rollback Testing
- Test ability to rollback to previous working state
- Validate backup and restore procedures
- Test graceful degradation scenarios

4. AI and ML services

### Phase 4: API Endpoints Restoration
1. Research endpoints
2. Analytics endpoints
3. Chat and interaction endpoints
4. Administrative endpoints

### Phase 5: Integration and Optimization
1. End-to-end testing
2. Performance optimization
3. Monitoring and alerting setup
4. Documentation updates

## Risk Mitigation

### Container Startup Failures
- **Risk**: Service imports cause container boot failures
- **Mitigation**: Conditional imports with fallbacks
- **Detection**: Container health checks and startup monitoring

### Service Dependencies
- **Risk**: Circular dependencies or missing services
- **Mitigation**: Dependency mapping and initialization order
- **Detection**: Service health monitoring and dependency checks

### Performance Degradation
- **Risk**: Added services slow down container startup
- **Mitigation**: Lazy loading and async initialization
- **Detection**: Startup time monitoring and performance metrics

### Data Consistency
- **Risk**: Database schema changes or migration issues
- **Mitigation**: Database migration scripts and rollback procedures
- **Detection**: Data validation and integrity checks
