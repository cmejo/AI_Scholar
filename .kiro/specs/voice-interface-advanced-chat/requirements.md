# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds voice interface capabilities and advanced chat modes to the existing basic chatbot application. The implementation will restore the voice-to-text, text-to-speech functionality, and enhanced chat modes including chain of thought reasoning and citation-aware responses that were present in the original complex application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to speak to the chatbot using my voice, so that I can interact hands-free and more naturally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks a microphone button THEN the system SHALL start recording audio from the user's microphone
2. WHEN the user is speaking THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback showing that audio is being captured
3. WHEN the user stops speaking or clicks the stop button THEN the system SHALL convert the speech to text using browser APIs
4. WHEN speech-to-text conversion is complete THEN the system SHALL populate the chat input field with the transcribed text
5. IF the browser does not support speech recognition THEN the system SHALL display a fallback message and hide the voice input button

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chatbot to speak its responses aloud, so that I can listen to responses while multitasking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the chatbot sends a response THEN the system SHALL provide a speaker button next to each message
2. WHEN the user clicks the speaker button THEN the system SHALL use text-to-speech to read the message aloud
3. WHEN text-to-speech is playing THEN the system SHALL show a visual indicator and allow the user to stop playback
4. WHEN the user navigates away or starts a new voice playback THEN the system SHALL stop any currently playing audio
5. IF the browser does not support text-to-speech THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating the feature is unavailable

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the AI's reasoning process, so that I can understand how it arrived at its conclusions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user enables "Chain of Thought" mode THEN the system SHALL request detailed reasoning from the AI
2. WHEN the AI responds in Chain of Thought mode THEN the system SHALL display the reasoning steps in an expandable section
3. WHEN the user clicks on the reasoning section THEN the system SHALL expand to show the full thought process
4. WHEN Chain of Thought mode is disabled THEN the system SHALL return to standard response format
5. WHEN switching between modes THEN the system SHALL preserve the current conversation context

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see citations and sources for AI responses, so that I can verify information and learn more.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user enables "Citation Mode" THEN the system SHALL request responses with source citations
2. WHEN the AI provides a response with citations THEN the system SHALL display clickable citation links
3. WHEN the user clicks a citation link THEN the system SHALL open the source in a new tab or show source details
4. WHEN no citations are available THEN the system SHALL indicate that the response is based on general knowledge
5. WHEN Citation Mode is active THEN the system SHALL show a visual indicator in the chat interface

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to switch between different chat modes easily, so that I can choose the most appropriate interaction style for my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the chat interface THEN the system SHALL display mode selection buttons or dropdown
2. WHEN the user selects a different chat mode THEN the system SHALL update the interface to reflect the new mode
3. WHEN switching modes THEN the system SHALL preserve the conversation history and context
4. WHEN a mode has specific features THEN the system SHALL show relevant UI elements (voice buttons, reasoning toggles, etc.)
5. WHEN the user refreshes the page THEN the system SHALL remember the last selected chat mode

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want voice commands to work reliably across different browsers and devices, so that I have a consistent experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL detect browser speech API support and show appropriate UI
2. WHEN using voice features on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL handle touch interactions and mobile-specific speech APIs
3. WHEN network connectivity is poor THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error messages for voice features
4. WHEN microphone permissions are denied THEN the system SHALL show clear instructions for enabling permissions
5. WHEN voice features encounter errors THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to text-only interaction
