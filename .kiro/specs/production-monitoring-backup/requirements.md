# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature encompasses the implementation of comprehensive production monitoring, automated backup services, and functionality testing for the AI Scholar Advanced RAG system. The system needs robust monitoring capabilities to ensure high availability, automated backup mechanisms to prevent data loss, and comprehensive testing procedures to validate all functionality works correctly in production.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive functionality testing capabilities, so that I can validate all system components are working correctly after deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN all core API endpoints SHALL be automatically tested for functionality
2. WHEN functionality tests are run THEN database connectivity SHALL be verified and reported
3. WHEN functionality tests are run THEN AI service integrations SHALL be tested and validated
4. WHEN functionality tests are run THEN file upload and processing capabilities SHALL be verified
5. WHEN functionality tests are run THEN user authentication and authorization SHALL be tested
6. WHEN functionality tests are run THEN real-time collaboration features SHALL be validated
7. WHEN tests complete THEN a comprehensive test report SHALL be generated with pass/fail status
8. IF any critical functionality fails THEN administrators SHALL be immediately notified

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automated backup services, so that critical data is protected and can be restored in case of system failure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backup service is configured THEN it SHALL automatically backup the PostgreSQL database daily
2. WHEN the backup service runs THEN it SHALL backup uploaded files and documents
3. WHEN the backup service runs THEN it SHALL backup vector database collections
4. WHEN the backup service runs THEN it SHALL backup system configuration files
5. WHEN backups are created THEN they SHALL be compressed and encrypted for security
6. WHEN backups are created THEN they SHALL be stored both locally and in cloud storage
7. WHEN backup retention policy is applied THEN old backups SHALL be automatically deleted after 30 days
8. WHEN backup fails THEN administrators SHALL be notified immediately
9. WHEN backup restoration is needed THEN the system SHALL provide easy restoration procedures

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring alerts, so that I can proactively address issues before they impact users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system resources exceed 80% utilization THEN alerts SHALL be sent to administrators
2. WHEN any service becomes unavailable THEN immediate alerts SHALL be triggered
3. WHEN database connections exceed safe limits THEN warnings SHALL be generated
4. WHEN API response times exceed 5 seconds THEN performance alerts SHALL be sent
5. WHEN disk space falls below 20% THEN storage alerts SHALL be triggered
6. WHEN SSL certificates are within 30 days of expiration THEN renewal alerts SHALL be sent
7. WHEN error rates exceed 5% THEN error alerts SHALL be generated
8. WHEN backup processes fail THEN backup failure alerts SHALL be sent immediately
9. WHEN security events are detected THEN security alerts SHALL be triggered
10. WHEN alerts are generated THEN they SHALL be sent via email and logged in the monitoring system

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want monitoring dashboards, so that I can visualize system health and performance metrics in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing monitoring dashboards THEN system resource utilization SHALL be displayed
2. WHEN viewing dashboards THEN service health status SHALL be shown for all components
3. WHEN monitoring dashboards load THEN API performance metrics SHALL be visualized
4. WHEN dashboards are accessed THEN database performance metrics SHALL be displayed
5. WHEN viewing monitoring THEN user activity and usage patterns SHALL be shown
6. WHEN dashboards load THEN error rates and logs SHALL be accessible
7. WHEN monitoring system THEN backup status and history SHALL be visible
8. WHEN accessing dashboards THEN security events and access logs SHALL be displayed

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automated health checks, so that system issues are detected and resolved automatically when possible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN health checks run THEN all service endpoints SHALL be tested every 30 seconds
2. WHEN health checks detect failures THEN automatic restart procedures SHALL be attempted
3. WHEN health checks run THEN database connectivity SHALL be verified continuously
4. WHEN health checks detect issues THEN detailed diagnostic information SHALL be collected
5. WHEN automatic recovery fails THEN manual intervention alerts SHALL be triggered
6. WHEN health checks run THEN SSL certificate validity SHALL be verified
7. WHEN health checks detect performance degradation THEN optimization recommendations SHALL be generated
8. WHEN health checks complete THEN results SHALL be logged and made available via API

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive logging and audit trails, so that I can troubleshoot issues and maintain compliance requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system events occur THEN they SHALL be logged with appropriate detail levels
2. WHEN user actions are performed THEN audit trails SHALL be maintained for compliance
3. WHEN errors occur THEN detailed error information SHALL be captured and stored
4. WHEN logs are generated THEN they SHALL be structured and searchable
5. WHEN log rotation occurs THEN old logs SHALL be archived and compressed
6. WHEN security events happen THEN they SHALL be logged with high priority
7. WHEN API calls are made THEN request/response details SHALL be logged for debugging
8. WHEN logs reach storage limits THEN automatic cleanup procedures SHALL be executed
