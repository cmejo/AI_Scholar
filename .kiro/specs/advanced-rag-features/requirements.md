# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the enhancement of the existing RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system with advanced features including hierarchical document processing, intelligent reasoning capabilities, memory management, personalization, analytics, and adaptive learning. These features will transform the current system into a sophisticated, context-aware knowledge management platform that learns from user interactions and provides increasingly accurate and personalized responses.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Hierarchical Document Chunking

**User Story:** As a user, I want documents to be intelligently chunked with overlap and sentence awareness, so that I get more coherent and contextually relevant search results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a document is uploaded THEN the system SHALL chunk it hierarchically with configurable overlap percentages
2. WHEN chunking occurs THEN the system SHALL preserve sentence boundaries to maintain semantic coherence
3. WHEN chunks are created THEN the system SHALL maintain parent-child relationships between different chunk levels
4. IF a chunk boundary would split a sentence THEN the system SHALL adjust the boundary to preserve sentence integrity
5. WHEN retrieving chunks THEN the system SHALL consider hierarchical context to improve relevance

### Requirement 2: Knowledge Graph Support

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to build and utilize knowledge graphs from my documents, so that I can discover relationships and connections between concepts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documents are processed THEN the system SHALL extract entities and relationships to build a knowledge graph
2. WHEN queries are made THEN the system SHALL use knowledge graph relationships to enhance retrieval
3. WHEN new documents are added THEN the system SHALL update the knowledge graph with new entities and relationships
4. IF entities are mentioned across documents THEN the system SHALL link them in the knowledge graph
5. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL provide relationship context from the knowledge graph

### Requirement 3: Memory & Context Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to remember our conversation and my preferences, so that interactions become more natural and personalized over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a conversation occurs THEN the system SHALL store short-term memory in SQLite or Redis
2. WHEN users interact over time THEN the system SHALL build long-term user memory including preferences and saved context
3. WHEN conversations become long THEN the system SHALL compress context through summarization
4. WHEN multi-turn queries are made THEN the system SHALL resolve references and maintain conversation flow
5. IF memory storage reaches capacity THEN the system SHALL intelligently prune older, less relevant memories

### Requirement 4: Intelligence & Reasoning

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to provide intelligent reasoning and fact-checking, so that I can trust the accuracy and depth of responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN complex queries are made THEN the system SHALL apply causal and analogical reasoning
2. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL provide uncertainty quantification with confidence scores
3. WHEN facts are presented THEN the system SHALL verify them through a fact-checking agent
4. WHEN summaries are requested THEN the system SHALL use a dedicated summarization agent
5. WHEN deep analysis is needed THEN the system SHALL employ a research agent for comprehensive topic exploration

### Requirement 5: Auto-Tagging and Metadata

**User Story:** As a user, I want documents to be automatically tagged with relevant metadata, so that I can find and organize content more effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documents are uploaded THEN the system SHALL generate LLM-assisted metadata tags
2. WHEN content is processed THEN the system SHALL perform trend analysis across document collections
3. WHEN reports are generated THEN the system SHALL create comparative analysis between documents
4. WHEN citations are needed THEN the system SHALL automatically generate proper citation formats
5. IF similar content is detected THEN the system SHALL suggest related tags and categories

### Requirement 6: Adaptive Learning & Continuous Improvement

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to learn from my usage patterns and feedback, so that it becomes more accurate and useful over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users interact with the system THEN it SHALL learn from query patterns and document usage
2. WHEN users provide feedback THEN the system SHALL incorporate ratings to improve future responses
3. WHEN usage patterns change THEN the system SHALL update retrieval strategies accordingly
4. WHEN new data is available THEN the system SHALL support embedding retraining
5. IF domain-specific usage is detected THEN the system SHALL adapt tuning for that domain

### Requirement 7: Analytics & Visualization

**User Story:** As a user, I want comprehensive analytics and visualizations of system usage and document relationships, so that I can understand and optimize my knowledge management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing analytics THEN the system SHALL display query frequency, document popularity, and performance metrics
2. WHEN viewing document relationships THEN the system SHALL provide visual mapping of connections
3. WHEN analyzing content THEN the system SHALL perform topic modeling across document collections
4. WHEN exploring knowledge THEN the system SHALL visualize knowledge graphs and content clustering
5. IF performance issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide latency and success rate analytics

### Requirement 8: Personalization & Adaptation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to adapt to my specific needs and preferences, so that I get increasingly personalized and relevant results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users register THEN the system SHALL create personalized user profiles
2. WHEN interactions occur THEN the system SHALL adapt retrieval based on user history
3. WHEN feedback is provided THEN the system SHALL implement a feedback loop to tune behavior
4. WHEN different document types are used THEN the system SHALL adapt to domain-specific requirements
5. IF user preferences change THEN the system SHALL update personalization accordingly
