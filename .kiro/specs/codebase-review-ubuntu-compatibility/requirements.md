# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves conducting a comprehensive review of the AI Scholar codebase to identify errors, compatibility issues with Ubuntu servers, and opportunities for improvements. The review will cover backend Python services, frontend React/TypeScript components, Docker configurations, deployment scripts, and infrastructure setup to ensure robust operation on Ubuntu server environments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the codebase to be fully compatible with Ubuntu server environments, so that I can deploy and maintain the application reliably on Ubuntu-based infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying on Ubuntu server THEN all Docker containers SHALL start successfully without compatibility errors
2. WHEN running deployment scripts on Ubuntu THEN all shell scripts SHALL execute without syntax or permission errors
3. WHEN installing dependencies on Ubuntu THEN all Python and Node.js packages SHALL install and function correctly
4. IF there are Ubuntu-specific path or permission issues THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and documentation for resolution

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all code errors and potential bugs to be identified and fixed, so that the application runs reliably without runtime failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing Python backend code THEN all syntax errors, import issues, and type inconsistencies SHALL be identified
2. WHEN reviewing TypeScript/React frontend code THEN all compilation errors, unused imports, and type mismatches SHALL be detected
3. WHEN examining configuration files THEN all malformed JSON, YAML, and environment variable references SHALL be corrected
4. WHEN testing database connections and queries THEN all SQL syntax errors and connection issues SHALL be resolved

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want Docker configurations and deployment scripts to be optimized for Ubuntu servers, so that containerized deployments are efficient and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building Docker images on Ubuntu THEN all Dockerfiles SHALL use Ubuntu-compatible base images and commands
2. WHEN running docker-compose on Ubuntu THEN all service configurations SHALL be compatible with Ubuntu's Docker version
3. WHEN executing deployment scripts THEN all bash commands SHALL work correctly on Ubuntu's default shell environment
4. IF there are volume mounting or networking issues THEN the configuration SHALL be updated to work with Ubuntu's Docker setup

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations to be identified and remediated, so that the application meets security best practices on Ubuntu servers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning for security issues THEN all known vulnerabilities in dependencies SHALL be identified and updated
2. WHEN reviewing file permissions THEN all scripts and configuration files SHALL have appropriate Ubuntu-compatible permissions
3. WHEN examining network configurations THEN all exposed ports and services SHALL be properly secured
4. WHEN checking authentication mechanisms THEN all security tokens and credentials SHALL be properly managed

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want code performance issues and resource inefficiencies to be identified, so that the application runs optimally on Ubuntu server hardware.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing resource usage THEN all memory leaks and CPU-intensive operations SHALL be identified
2. WHEN reviewing database queries THEN all inefficient queries and missing indexes SHALL be optimized
3. WHEN examining caching strategies THEN all opportunities for performance improvement SHALL be documented
4. WHEN testing under load THEN the application SHALL perform within acceptable response time limits on Ubuntu servers

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a maintenance developer, I want code quality issues and technical debt to be identified with specific improvement recommendations, so that the codebase remains maintainable and follows best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing code structure THEN all violations of coding standards and best practices SHALL be documented
2. WHEN analyzing dependencies THEN all outdated or unnecessary packages SHALL be identified for update or removal
3. WHEN examining error handling THEN all missing try-catch blocks and error scenarios SHALL be addressed
4. WHEN reviewing documentation THEN all missing or outdated documentation SHALL be flagged for updates
