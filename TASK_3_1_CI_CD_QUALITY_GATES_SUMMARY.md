   - No `any` types permitted

2. **ESLint Quality Rules**
   - Zero errors required for merge
   - Maximum 10 warnings (configurable)
   - React hooks dependency checking
   - Import organization enforcement

3. **Test Coverage Requirements**
   - Minimum 80% statement coverage
   - Minimum 75% branch coverage
   - Minimum 85% function coverage
   - Coverage reports in multiple formats

4. **Code Formatting Standards**
   - Prettier formatting enforcement
   - Consistent code style across project
   - Automated formatting checks

### Backend Quality Gates

1. **Python Code Quality**
   - Black formatting standards
   - isort import organization
   - flake8 linting with zero errors
   - Maximum complexity of 10 per function

2. **Type Safety Enforcement**
   - mypy strict type checking
   - All functions require type hints
   - Zero type errors allowed

3. **Security Analysis**
   - Bandit security scanning
   - Zero high-severity issues allowed
   - Dependency vulnerability checking
   - Safety scanning for known vulnerabilities

4. **Test Coverage Requirements**
   - Minimum 80% coverage threshold
   - pytest with comprehensive reporting
   - Coverage in XML, HTML, and JSON formats

### Integration Quality Gates

1. **End-to-End Testing**
   - API integration tests
   - Database operation tests
   - External service integration tests

2. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Build time tracking
   - Test execution time monitoring
   - Bundle size analysis

## Automated Reporting

### Generated Reports

1. **ESLint Analysis Reports**
   - JSON format for programmatic analysis
   - Detailed error and warning breakdown
   - File-by-file analysis

2. **Coverage Reports**
   - HTML reports for visual analysis
   - LCOV format for CI integration
   - JSON format for metrics collection

3. **Security Analysis Reports**
   - Bandit security scan results
   - Dependency vulnerability reports
   - Risk assessment and recommendations

4. **Quality Summary Reports**
   - Comprehensive markdown reports
   - Quality metrics dashboard
   - Trend analysis and recommendations

### Report Distribution

- **GitHub Actions Artifacts**: All reports uploaded as artifacts
- **Pull Request Comments**: Quality summary posted automatically
- **Codecov Integration**: Coverage reports sent to Codecov
- **Local Development**: Reports saved to `quality-reports/` directory

## Quality Gate Enforcement

### Hard Gates (Build Fails)

- TypeScript compilation errors
- ESLint errors
- Python linting errors (flake8)
- Python type errors (mypy)
- High-severity security issues
- Test failures
- Coverage below minimum threshold

### Soft Gates (Warnings Only)

- ESLint warnings above threshold
- Medium/low-severity security issues
- Bundle size above recommended limit
- Build time exceeding targets

### Emergency Procedures

- Admin override capability
- Emergency branch creation
- Temporary bypass with `[skip ci]`
- Manual approval process for critical fixes

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Pre-commit Hooks

- Husky integration for git hooks
- lint-staged for staged file processing
- Automatic formatting and linting
- Type checking before commit

### Local Development

- `npm run quality:check` - Full quality validation
- `npm run quality:fix` - Auto-fix formatting and linting
- `./scripts/quality-check.sh` - Comprehensive local analysis
- `./scripts/validate-quality-gates.sh` - Configuration validation

### CI/CD Pipeline

1. **Trigger**: Push to main/develop or pull request
2. **Parallel Execution**: Frontend and backend quality checks
3. **Integration Testing**: End-to-end test execution
4. **Quality Evaluation**: Aggregate results and make decision
5. **Reporting**: Generate and distribute quality reports
6. **Gate Decision**: Allow or block merge based on results

## Metrics and Monitoring

### Key Performance Indicators

- **Error Rate**: Quality gate failure percentage
- **Coverage Trends**: Test coverage over time
- **Build Success Rate**: Successful build percentage
- **Time to Resolution**: Average fix time for quality issues

### Quality Metrics Collected

- Lines of code analyzed
- Number of issues found and fixed
- Test coverage percentages
- Security vulnerabilities detected
- Performance metrics (build time, bundle size)

PYTHON_VERSION: '3.11'
COVERAGE_THRESHOLD: 80
MAX_ESLINT_WARNINGS: 10
