```

### Nginx Configuration
```bash
# Main nginx config
/etc/nginx/sites-available/ai-scholar

# SSL configuration
/etc/nginx/ssl/

# Monitoring config
/opt/nginx-monitoring/configs/alerts.conf
```

### Security Configuration
```bash
# Firewall rules
sudo ufw status numbered

# Fail2ban status
sudo fail2ban-client status

# SSL certificate
sudo certbot certificates
```

## üìä Monitoring Commands

### Daily Monitoring
```bash
# Interactive dashboard
sudo /opt/nginx-monitoring/scripts/dashboard.sh

# Check service status
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml ps

# View recent logs
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log

# Check SSL certificate expiry
sudo certbot certificates
```

### Weekly Maintenance
```bash
# System updates
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

# Security scan
sudo /opt/nginx-monitoring/scripts/security-monitor.sh

# Performance report
sudo /opt/nginx-monitoring/scripts/performance-monitor.sh report

# Backup verification
ls -la /var/backups/ai-scholar/
```

## üö® Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### SSL Certificate Issues
```bash
# Check certificate status
sudo certbot certificates

# Renew manually
sudo certbot renew --dry-run
sudo certbot renew

# Test SSL configuration
openssl s_client -connect yourdomain.com:443
```

#### Service Not Starting
```bash
# Check Docker services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml ps
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs

# Check nginx
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl status nginx
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
```

#### Performance Issues
```bash
# Check resource usage
htop
iotop
df -h

# Monitor nginx performance
sudo /opt/nginx-monitoring/scripts/performance-monitor.sh monitor

# Check upstream services
curl http://localhost:8001/health
curl http://localhost:3006/health
```

#### Security Alerts
```bash
# Check fail2ban status
sudo fail2ban-client status
sudo fail2ban-client status nginx-limit-req

# Review security logs
sudo grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
```

## üìà Scaling Considerations

### When to Scale
- [ ] CPU usage consistently >80%
- [ ] Memory usage consistently >80%
- [ ] Response times >2 seconds
- [ ] Error rates >1%
- [ ] Concurrent users approaching limits

### Scaling Options
- [ ] Vertical scaling (larger server)
- [ ] Horizontal scaling (multiple servers)
- [ ] Database optimization
- [ ] CDN implementation
- [ ] Load balancer setup

## üîê Security Maintenance

### Monthly Security Tasks
- [ ] Review access logs for suspicious activity
- [ ] Update all system packages
- [ ] Check SSL certificate expiry
- [ ] Review firewall rules
- [ ] Audit user accounts and permissions
- [ ] Test backup and recovery procedures

### Quarterly Security Audit
- [ ] Full security scan
- [ ] Penetration testing
- [ ] SSL configuration review
- [ ] Access control audit
- [ ] Incident response plan review
- [ ] Security training update

## üìû Emergency Procedures

### Service Down
1. Check service status: `docker-compose ps`
2. Check logs: `docker-compose logs`
3. Restart services: `docker-compose restart`
4. Check nginx: `sudo systemctl status nginx`
5. Review error logs: `sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log`

### Security Incident
1. Isolate affected systems
2. Review security logs
3. Block malicious IPs: `sudo ufw deny from IP_ADDRESS`
4. Check fail2ban: `sudo fail2ban-client status`
5. Document incident
6. Update security measures

### SSL Certificate Expiry
1. Check certificate: `sudo certbot certificates`
2. Renew certificate: `sudo certbot renew`
3. Test renewal: `sudo certbot renew --dry-run`
4. Restart nginx: `sudo systemctl restart nginx`
5. Verify SSL: Test at ssllabs.com
