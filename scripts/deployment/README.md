## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Configuration

Copy the environment template and configure for your environment:

```bash
cp config/deployment.env.example .env.production
```

Edit `.env.production` with your specific configuration:

- Database credentials
- API keys (OpenAI, Hugging Face)
- AWS credentials for mobile app deployment
- Notification webhooks (Slack, email)
- SSL certificate paths

### 2. Docker Registry Setup

Configure your Docker registry (GitHub Container Registry by default):

```bash
# Login to GitHub Container Registry
echo $GITHUB_TOKEN | docker login ghcr.io -u $GITHUB_USERNAME --password-stdin

# Or configure for other registries
export REGISTRY=your-registry.com
export IMAGE_NAME=your-org/ai-scholar-rag
```

### 3. Infrastructure Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed and configured:

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Nginx (for load balancing)
- SSL certificates (Let's Encrypt recommended)
- Database backup storage (AWS S3 or similar)

### 4. Initial Deployment

Run the initial deployment:

```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/deployment/*.sh

# Run initial deployment
./scripts/deployment/deploy.sh deploy v1.0.0 blue-green
```

## üîÑ Deployment Strategies

### Blue-Green Deployment (Recommended)

Zero-downtime deployment with automatic rollback:

```bash
# Deploy to inactive environment and switch traffic
./scripts/deployment/blue-green-deployment.sh latest

# Manual traffic switch
./scripts/deployment/switch-traffic.sh blue

# Rollback if needed
./scripts/deployment/rollback.sh auto
```

### Rolling Deployment

Update services one by one:

```bash
./scripts/deployment/deploy.sh deploy latest rolling
```

### Recreate Deployment

Full restart (with downtime):

```bash
./scripts/deployment/deploy.sh deploy latest recreate
```

## üì± Mobile App Deployment

### Prerequisites

1. **Android**: Configure Google Play Console API access
2. **iOS**: Configure App Store Connect API access
3. **PWA**: Configure CDN (AWS CloudFront/S3)

### Configuration

Set up mobile deployment secrets in GitHub:

```bash
# Android
ANDROID_KEYSTORE          # Base64 encoded keystore
KEYSTORE_PASSWORD         # Keystore password
KEY_ALIAS                 # Key alias
KEY_PASSWORD              # Key password
GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT # Service account JSON

# iOS
APPLE_ID_USERNAME         # Apple ID username
APPLE_ID_PASSWORD         # App-specific password

# PWA
PWA_S3_BUCKET_PROD       # Production S3 bucket
PWA_S3_BUCKET_STAGING    # Staging S3 bucket
CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID_PROD   # CloudFront distribution ID
CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID_STAGING # Staging CloudFront ID
```

### Deployment Process

Mobile apps are automatically deployed when changes are pushed to the main branch:

1. **Build**: Apps are built for Android and iOS
2. **Test**: Automated testing on multiple devices
3. **Deploy**: 
   - PWA deployed to CDN
   - Android APK uploaded to Google Play
   - iOS IPA uploaded to App Store Connect

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Migrations
