2. **Harmonized Quality Standards**
   ```python
   # Example: Multi-institutional quality assurance
   from ai_scholar.compliance import GlobalCompliance
   
   compliance = GlobalCompliance()
   
   # Check multi-jurisdictional compliance
   compliance_check = compliance.verify_global_compliance(
       project_id="global-healthcare-ai-2024",
       institutions=["mit", "barcelona", "tokyo"],
       data_types=["clinical", "genomic", "imaging"],
       regulations=["hipaa", "gdpr", "appi"]
   )
   
   # Results show compliance status across all jurisdictions
   compliance_status = compliance_check.get_status()
   # All institutions: COMPLIANT ‚úÖ
   # Recommendations: Update data retention policies for GDPR compliance
   ```
