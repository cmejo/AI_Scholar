- `categories`: Memoized category extraction
- `selectedItemsSet`: Memoized Set for O(1) lookups

### 4. Enhanced Code Splitting
Implemented advanced lazy loading with performance monitoring:

#### Created Enhanced Utilities
- **codeSplitting.ts**: Advanced lazy loading with retry logic, error handling, and performance monitoring
- **performanceOptimizations.ts**: Comprehensive performance utilities including debouncing, throttling, and virtualization
- **usePerformanceOptimization.ts**: Custom hooks for performance optimization

#### Enhanced Lazy Loading
- Replaced basic `lazy()` calls with `createMonitoredLazyComponent()`
- Added performance monitoring for component load times
- Implemented retry logic for failed component loads
- Added preloading capabilities for critical components

### 5. Virtualization Implementation
Enhanced the PerformanceOptimizedList component:
- **Virtual scrolling**: Only renders visible items for large lists
- **Overscan support**: Renders additional items outside viewport for smooth scrolling
- **Performance metrics**: Real-time display of virtualization effectiveness
- **Memory optimization**: Efficient handling of large datasets (10,000+ items)

### 6. Performance Monitoring
Created comprehensive performance monitoring system:

#### PerformanceMonitor Component
- Real-time render time tracking
- Memory usage monitoring
- Performance threshold alerts
- Automatic performance tips
- Development-only display

#### Performance Hooks
- `usePerformanceMonitor()`: Track component performance metrics
- `useDebounce()`: Debounce expensive operations
- `useThrottle()`: Throttle high-frequency events
- `useVirtualizedList()`: Efficient list rendering

### 7. Import Optimizations
- **Tree shaking**: Optimized imports to reduce bundle size
- **Dynamic imports**: Lazy load heavy components only when needed
- **Bundle splitting**: Separate chunks for different feature areas
- **Preloading**: Strategic preloading of critical components

### 8. Missing React Imports Fixed
Fixed missing React hook imports across components:
- Added `useCallback`, `useMemo`, `Suspense` imports where needed
- Fixed TypeScript compilation errors
- Ensured proper dependency arrays for all hooks

## Performance Improvements Achieved

### 1. Render Performance
- **Reduced unnecessary re-renders**: React.memo prevents child re-renders when props haven't changed
- **Optimized callback stability**: useCallback prevents function recreation
- **Memoized expensive computations**: useMemo caches complex calculations

### 2. Bundle Performance  
- **Code splitting**: Reduced initial bundle size by lazy loading components
- **Dynamic imports**: Components load only when needed
- **Performance monitoring**: Track and optimize component load times

### 3. List Performance
- **Virtualization**: Handle large lists (10,000+ items) efficiently
- **Debounced search**: Prevent excessive filtering operations
- **Optimized lookups**: Use Set for O(1) selected item checks

### 4. Memory Performance
- **Stable references**: Prevent memory leaks from recreated functions
- **Efficient data structures**: Use appropriate data structures for performance
- **Memory monitoring**: Track memory usage in development

## Development Tools Added

### 1. Performance Monitor
- Real-time performance metrics display
- Render time tracking and alerts
- Memory usage monitoring
- Performance optimization suggestions

### 2. Lazy Loading Monitor
- Component load time tracking
- Failed load retry logic
- Performance metrics collection
- Development logging

### 3. Virtualization Metrics
- Visible item range display
- Performance statistics
- Memory usage optimization
- Scroll performance tracking
