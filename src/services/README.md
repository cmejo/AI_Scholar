# Services Directory

This directory contains all service classes and modules that provide core functionality for the AI Scholar RAG chatbot application. Services are organized by domain and provide clean APIs for business logic, data processing, and external integrations.

## Architecture Overview

Services follow a modular architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns:

- **Data Services**: Handle data persistence, retrieval, and transformation
- **Analytics Services**: Provide insights, metrics, and reporting capabilities  
- **Integration Services**: Manage external API connections and third-party services
- **Processing Services**: Handle complex business logic and data processing
- **Utility Services**: Provide common functionality used across the application

## Service Categories

### Analytics & Insights
- **[AnalyticsService](./analyticsService.ts)**: Comprehensive analytics tracking and reporting
- **[ChartService](./chartService.ts)**: Interactive chart rendering and visualization
- **[ErrorTrackingService](./errorTrackingService.ts)**: Error monitoring and incident management

### Content & Document Processing
- **[CitationService](./citationService.ts)**: Academic citation generation and formatting
- **[MultiDocumentComparison](./multiDocumentComparison.ts)**: Document comparison and analysis
- **[MultiModalService](./multiModalService.ts)**: Multi-modal content processing

### Search & Retrieval
- **[HybridSearchService](./hybridSearchService.ts)**: Advanced search capabilities
- **[MemoryService](./memoryService.ts)**: Conversation memory and context management

### User Experience
- **[PersonalizationService](./personalizationService.ts)**: User preference and customization
- **[VoiceService](./voiceService.ts)**: Voice interaction and speech processing
- **[AccessibilityService](./accessibilityService.ts)**: Accessibility features and compliance

### Integration & Workflow
- **[IntegrationService](./integrationService.ts)**: External system integrations
- **[WorkflowService](./workflowService.ts)**: Automated workflow management
- **[PluginService](./pluginService.ts)**: Plugin system and extensibility

### Security & Monitoring
- **[SecurityService](./securityService.ts)**: Security validation and protection
- **[BiasDetectionService](./biasDetectionService.ts)**: AI bias detection and mitigation

## Usage Patterns

### Service Instantiation

Most services follow the singleton pattern for efficient resource management:

```typescript
import { analyticsService } from './analyticsService';
import { chartService } from './chartService';

// Services are pre-instantiated and ready to use
analyticsService.logQuery(queryData);
chartService.renderChart('chartId', config);
```

### Error Handling

All services implement consistent error handling patterns:

```typescript
try {
  const result = await someService.performOperation(data);
  return result;
} catch (error) {
  // Services automatically log errors to errorTrackingService
  console.error('Operation failed:', error);
  throw error;
}
```

### Type Safety

Services are fully typed with TypeScript interfaces:

```typescript
import { QueryAnalytics, ChartConfiguration } from '../types/api';

// All service methods have proper type definitions
const analytics: QueryAnalytics = {
  query: "What is machine learning?",
  userId: "user123",
  timestamp: new Date(),
  responseTime: 1500,
  success: true,
  satisfaction: 0.85,
  intent: "definition",
  documentsUsed: ["doc1", "doc2"]
};

analyticsService.logQuery(analytics);
```

## Testing

Each service has corresponding test files in the `__tests__` directory:

```bash
# Run all service tests
npm test src/services

# Run specific service tests
npm test src/services/__tests__/analyticsService.test.ts
```

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Management
- Services implement proper cleanup methods
- Large datasets are processed in chunks
- Caching is used strategically to improve performance

### Async Operations
- All I/O operations are asynchronous
- Services implement proper timeout handling
- Concurrent operations are managed with appropriate limits

### Resource Optimization
- Services lazy-load dependencies when possible
- Heavy computations are debounced or throttled
- Memory usage is monitored and optimized

## Configuration

Services can be configured through environment variables and configuration files:

```typescript
// Example service configuration
const config = {
  analytics: {
    batchSize: 100,
    flushInterval: 5000,
    retentionDays: 90
  },
  charts: {
    defaultTheme: 'dark',
    animationDuration: 300,
    maxDataPoints: 1000
  }
};
```

## Adding New Services

When adding new services, follow these guidelines:

1. **Create the service class** with proper TypeScript types
2. **Add comprehensive JSDoc documentation** for all public methods
3. **Implement error handling** and logging
4. **Write unit tests** with good coverage
5. **Update this README** with service description
6. **Add to the main exports** if needed

### Service Template

```typescript
/**
 * @fileoverview [Service Name] Service
 * [Brief description of what the service does]
 * 
 * @author AI Scholar Team
 * @version 1.0.0
 * @since 2024-01-01
 */

/**
 * [Service Name] Service
 * 
 * [Detailed description of service capabilities]
 * 
 * @class [ServiceName]Service
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import { serviceInstance } from './serviceName';
 * 
 * // Example usage
 * const result = await serviceInstance.performOperation(data);
 * ```
 */
export class ServiceNameService {
  /**
   * [Method description]
   * 
   * @param {Type} param - Parameter description
   * @returns {Promise<ReturnType>} Description of return value
   * 
   * @example
   * ```typescript
   * const result = await service.method(param);
   * ```
   */
  async method(param: Type): Promise<ReturnType> {
    // Implementation
  }
}

export const serviceInstance = new ServiceNameService();
```

## API Documentation

For detailed API documentation of each service, see the individual service files. All public methods are documented with JSDoc comments including:

- Parameter types and descriptions
- Return value types and descriptions
- Usage examples
- Error conditions
- Performance considerations
